    <div>The pace of development in quantum computing mirrors the rapid advances made in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is natural to ask whether quantum technologies could boost learning algorithms: this field of enquiry is called quantum machine learning. This massively open online course (MOOC) on edX is offered by the University of Toronto on edX with an emphasis on what benefits current and near-future quantum technologies may bring to machine learning. These notebooks contain the lecture notes and the code for the course. The content is organized in four modules, with an additional introductory module to the course itself.</div>

<center><b>Since the course is hands-on, we found it important that you can try the code on actual quantum computers if you want to. There isn't a single, unified programming framework that would allow to address all available quantum hardware. For this reason, the notebooks are available in two versions: one in <mark>Qiskit</mark> targeting the IBM Q hardware and the <mark>Forest SDK</mark> targetting the Rigetti quantum computer. The notebooks also cover quantum annealing -- for that, the D-Wave Ocean Suite is used. For more details on setting up your computational environment locally, refer to the notebooks in Module 0.</b></center>
